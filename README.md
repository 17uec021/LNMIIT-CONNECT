# LNMIIT CONNECT
LNMIIT Connect is a social network that provides the students of college a platform to connect with their seniors, juniors, teachers as
well as alumni for sharing of information and resources.

The whole project is majorly made using PHP. PhpMyAdmin is used as the database, and
JavaScript frameworks are used in the Front End part. We have used XAMPP to run the application
since it is a free and open-source cross-platform and consists of Apache HTTP Server.
